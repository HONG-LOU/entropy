# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The protocol identity is the network
compatibility boundary; a `mainnet` identity is not a security or audit claim.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.11] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Desktop updates now prefer the official `entcoin.xyz` release mirror and
  automatically fall back to GitHub while keeping the expected SHA-256 digest
  anchored to the matching GitHub Release checksum manifest.
- Interrupted installer downloads remain in the protected update cache and
  resume with bounded HTTP Range requests. Servers that reject or ignore a
  range request safely restart the artifact from byte zero.
- Website download actions now use the same versioned release mirror.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Desktop transaction filters now query up to 100 matching wallet records from
  SQLite instead of filtering only the latest 100 mixed transaction records.
- The update button now shows real byte-based download progress with a filled
  progress state, followed by explicit verification and installation phases.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added complete English and Simplified Chinese desktop interfaces for Windows
  and Linux, including startup, wallet, transactions, mining, diagnostics,
  storage, updates, dialogs, validation, and operation feedback.
- Added a compact language control that follows the operating-system language
  on first launch and remembers the user's selection afterward.

### Changed

- Dates and numeric values now follow the selected desktop language, while
  protocol identifiers, addresses, hashes, file types, and currency symbols
  retain their exact technical representation.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added `All`, `Received`, `Sent`, and `Mining` filters to the desktop
  transaction history without changing the loaded history or detail view.
- Added an HTTPS update-manifest fallback at `entcoin.xyz/update.json` for
  desktop clients that cannot reach the GitHub release feed.

### Changed

- Desktop updates now install after checksum verification, close the current
  process, and relaunch Entcoin automatically. Linux still requires the normal
  Polkit authorization prompt, and unsigned Windows builds may show SmartScreen.
- Update metadata and checksum downloads retry temporary network failures.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Unified the website favicon and Windows desktop package icon with the custom
  Entcoin E used by Linux packages, the PWA, and website branding.
- Replaced obsolete test-network/value disclaimers in current product surfaces
  with the live two-region public seed topology and local-validation model.
- Kept `entropy-mainnet-v1`, `entropy.db`, and legacy Entropy data-directory
  detection unchanged as protocol and wallet compatibility identifiers.

### Security

- v1.0.7 Windows artifacts remain unsigned and may trigger Microsoft Defender
  SmartScreen; published SHA-256 manifests cover every release executable.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- A desktop software-update surface that checks the official GitHub Release,
  selects the current platform installer, downloads it into the user cache,
  verifies it against the matching SHA-256 release manifest, and opens the
  operating-system installer for explicit user approval.

### Fixed

- Recoverable WebSocket peer reconcile failures remain attached to the failed
  peer instead of permanently changing the desktop node state to `Node warning`.

### Security

- Update metadata and artifacts are bounded, accepted only from trusted GitHub
  HTTPS hosts, matched to exact release asset names, and verified before launch.
- v1.0.6 Windows artifacts remain unsigned and may trigger Microsoft Defender
  SmartScreen; the updater does not bypass operating-system trust prompts.

### Compatibility

- Consensus identity `entropy-mainnet-v1`, blocks, transactions, addresses,
  wallets, vaults, database layout, and peer protocol are unchanged from
  v1.0.0-v1.0.5.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Clickable and keyboard-accessible desktop transaction details with status,
  confirmations, block metadata, inputs, outputs, and pruned-body state.
- Optional SHA-256 Authenticode signing with RFC 3161 timestamps for Windows
  desktop, installer, and CLI artifacts when a CA certificate is configured.

### Changed

- Product branding, executables, installers, packages, CLI commands, service
  names, repository links, and website assets now use Entcoin.
- The source repository moved to `HONG-LOU/entcoin`.
- New installations use Entcoin application-data and Linux Secret Service
  names while existing Entropy mainnet data and wallet keys remain available.

### Security

- v1.0.5 Windows artifacts are published unsigned and may trigger Microsoft
  Defender SmartScreen. SHA-256 checksums provide integrity, not publisher
  identity or reputation.

### Compatibility

- Consensus identity `entropy-mainnet-v1`, genesis hash domains, transaction
  signatures, wallet formats and derivation, addresses, and `entropy.db` are
  unchanged from v1.0.0-v1.0.4.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Desktop chain status now reports synchronization only when an active peer
  sync targets a height above the local validated tip. Polling an equal or
  behind peer no longer leaves an up-to-date node labelled as synchronizing.
- Website icon URLs are versioned so browsers refresh the Entcoin E mark
  instead of retaining an older cached application or favicon asset.

### Compatibility

- Consensus, `entropy-mainnet-v1`, blocks, transactions, addresses, wallets,
  vaults, and the wire protocol are unchanged from v1.0.0-v1.0.3.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- A second public archive seed, `https://node.entcoin.xyz`, in the remotely
  refreshed mainnet bootstrap manifest.
- Automatic desktop transaction fees based on the transaction's encoded size
  and the node's minimum relay policy.

### Changed

- Direct-extension synchronization now reuses each validated 128-header page
  across sixteen bounded 8-block body requests instead of discarding all but
  eight headers. Scheduled HTTP sync rounds may run for up to two minutes.
- The desktop replaces the detailed Network page and manual peer form with a
  compact Online, Syncing, Connecting, Behind, or Offline status.

### Compatibility

- Consensus, `entropy-mainnet-v1`, blocks, transactions, addresses, wallets,
  vaults, and the wire protocol are unchanged from v1.0.0-v1.0.2.
- Older nodes discover both archive seeds when they next refresh the public
  manifest; installing v1.0.3 is required only for the faster synchronizer and
  desktop changes.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Lightweight multi-wallet profiles over one chain database, including create,
  recovery/backup import, switching, export, and guarded removal in the desktop
  application.
- A prioritized maturity roadmap covering audit, hash-power, release,
  bootstrap/eclipse, wallet, fee-market, sync, privacy, and operations gaps.

### Changed

- Inbound WebSocket source addresses are no longer persisted as dialable peers.
  Bidirectional reconciliation continues on the established socket without
  requiring a NAT callback.
- Startup removes old automatically discovered peers that have never succeeded
  and accumulated at least eight failures. Manual and bootstrap peers remain.
- Wallet import preserves the existing wallet instead of replacing it. The
  active wallet must be backed up before switching, and active or unsecured
  profiles cannot be removed.
- Portable backups cannot be written inside the live node data directory.

### Compatibility

- `entropy-mainnet-v1`, genesis, consensus, transaction encoding, addresses,
  wallet derivation, and `.entwallet` format are unchanged from v1.0.0/v1.0.1.
- Existing `wallet.vault` files are registered as the first profile on startup;
  no chain resynchronization or wallet re-import is required.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Ubuntu 24.04+ amd64 desktop wallet/node package with the same mainnet,
  recovery phrase, encrypted backup, transaction, synchronization, and mining
  behavior as the Windows application.
- Linux local-wallet protection using Secret Service for a user-scoped random
  master key and XChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated `wallet.vault`
  encryption.
- Native Linux desktop and CLI binaries, `.deb` packaging, menu integration,
  and Linux release checksums.

### Changed

- Release automation now builds Windows and Ubuntu artifacts independently and
  publishes them together only after both platform jobs succeed.

### Compatibility

- `entropy-mainnet-v1`, genesis, consensus, wallet derivation, addresses, and
  portable `.entwallet` backups are unchanged from v1.0.0.
- Windows DPAPI vaults remain Windows-local. Move a wallet between Windows and
  Ubuntu with its 24-word phrase or an encrypted `.entwallet` backup.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Public `entropy-mainnet-v1` network with a new reward-free genesis block.
- Built-in HTTPS bootstrap-manifest discovery through the public repository and
  its CDN mirror, with a verified public archive seed at
  `https://template-chat.xyz`.
- Optional Windows archive-seed deployment package with Caddy HTTPS/WSS
  termination, service accounts, scheduled startup, firewall setup, health
  checks, and uninstall support.
- Explicit Linux/Windows seed mode with archive-only storage, an ephemeral
  non-financial identity, no persistent wallet, and disabled wallet/mining
  operations.
- Release artifacts for the desktop app, installer, headless CLI, public-seed
  deployment package, and SHA-256 checksums.

### Changed

- Desktop and package metadata now report version `1.0.0`.
- Fresh Windows mainnet state is isolated under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Entropy\mainnet-v1`; published testnet directories are never
  selected automatically.
- A fresh desktop database starts pruned with a 20,000-block body horizon and
  then respects the persisted operator choice. CLI nodes remain archive by
  default, and the public-seed deployment enforces archive mode.
- Coinbase maturity is 100 blocks beginning with the first reward block at
  height 1. The target remains one block per 10 seconds, exactly 2,000,000 ENT
  over 31,536,000 reward-bearing heights, approximately ten years.
- HTTP and WebSocket endpoints retain the `/v2` transport path even though the
  network identity is `entropy-mainnet-v1`.

### Compatibility

- `entropy-mainnet-v1` rejects every testnet protocol identity and uses a new
  genesis, so old testnet chains are neither migrated nor replayed.
- Wallet control can be restored on mainnet from a known 24-word recovery phrase
  or verified `.entwallet` backup. Chain/database files must not be copied into
  the mainnet directory.
- The published HTTPS archive seed enables automatic cross-internet discovery;
  manually configured peers remain available for manifest or seed outages.

### Security status

- The source repository is public, but v1.0.0 has not received an independent
  consensus, cryptography, wallet, P2P, persistence, or desktop audit.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- SQLite WAL ledger with indexed UTXOs, wallet history, persistent mempool and
  peers, health records, full-synchronous writes, and startup integrity checks.
- Per-block undo records and atomic cumulative-work chain reorganization with
  orphaned-transaction mempool revalidation.
- Persistent archive/pruned storage policy and irreversible body/undo pruning.
- Header-first incremental HTTP synchronization and requested body batches.
- WebSocket transaction/block relay with keepalive, connection, message, and
  per-IP limits.
- Automatic LAN multicast discovery and persistent exponential peer backoff.
- Windows user-scope DPAPI wallet vault.
- New-wallet 24-word BIP39 recovery using a versioned Entcoin P-256 derivation.
- Portable Argon2id/XChaCha20-Poly1305 `.entwallet` export and restore.
- Desktop transaction history, confirmation/spendable state, peer management,
  wallet recovery, database diagnostics, and pruning workflow.
- Headless `history`, `wallet-backup`, and `wallet-migrate` commands.
- NSIS installer build and release SHA-256 checksum generation.
- Single-instance desktop activation, automatic occupied-port fallback, and a
  pinned tag-to-GitHub-Release workflow.

### Changed

- Network identity is now `entropy-testnet-v3`.
- Chain state moved from whole-file JSON replay to incremental SQLite commits.
- Synchronization compares and validates headers before downloading candidate
  bodies and never accepts a serialized remote state wholesale.
- Coinbase outputs require 100-block maturity beginning at spending height 100,
  preserving the earlier published testnet history.
- Retry failures, manual/discovered peer state, and storage policy survive node
  restart.
- Desktop startup treats missing/corrupt backend, wallet, and ledger state as a
  fatal error instead of showing placeholder data.
- Clean Windows installs now store live data under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`; existing
  `%APPDATA%` wallets and chains are detected and reused.
- Mempool relay now enforces aggregate byte/input budgets and a minimum fee,
  while mixed-case hexadecimal addresses remain visible and spendable.
- Peer synchronization now rejects redirects, rate-limits validation work,
  folds replayed local prefixes, bounds disk staging, and cancels stale mining
  templates as soon as the active tip changes.

### Migration

- Valid `chain.json` and `peers.json` are imported and verified before becoming
  `.migrated.bak` files.
- Plaintext `wallet.json` requires an explicit migration that creates and
  verifies both local DPAPI and portable password-encrypted copies before
  deleting plaintext.
- A disagreement between legacy and SQLite chain tips stops migration without
  replacing either copy.

### Removed

- `GET/POST /v1/state` whole-state synchronization.
- New plaintext wallet storage.
- Production frontend mock data and simulated backend success paths.

### Security status

- v0.2 is a public testnet and has not received an independent audit.
- Release binaries are not Authenticode-signed and builds are not yet
  reproducible.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial educational MVP with a Wails desktop wallet/node, P-256 signed UTXO
  transfers, proof of work, exact 2,000,000 ENT height-based emission, manual
  HTTP peers, and atomic JSON persistence.
- Superseded by v0.2 and no longer supported.
